# Getting started

**Hof.js is based on web components**. These are a group of W3C standards that allow the creation of new HTML elements. Hof.js **simplifies their implementation extremely** and offers **many additional features like deep observability** out-of-the-box.

Hof.js supports
- **enriching an existing website** by implementing individual parts using Hof.js components or
- **building a complete app** based on nested Hof.js components.

These and other concepts will be explained step by step in this guide.

> All **samples in this guide are interactive**. This means **you can interact with the rendered ui**!
