# Modern development

As shown in the previous chapters, **Hof.js provides a quickstart to web development by using the nomodule variant of the library**:
- You can include Hof.js and JS files of your components in a web page using separate script tags.
- This can be useful to enrich an existing website by implementing parts using Hof.js components.

**However, if you want to build a complete app based on Hof.js**, you should **use modularized JavaScript instead**.

Also, in **more complex applications**, **you want optimal IDE support including autocomplete for regular elements and HofHtmlElement components** including their properties.

You can also **test a Hof.js application interactively by changing the underlying data model in the browser**. In doing so, you can watch the changes to the properties of the Hof.js components and the corresponding UI updates live.

All **this is also possible with Hof.js** and will be examined in more detail in the following sections.
