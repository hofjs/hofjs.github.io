# Routing

**Hof.js router** is a **modern routing framework** and part of **Hof.js**. It is an **open source project of Hof University of Applied Sciences** and **was created by Prof. Dr. Walter Kern**.

## Key features
This framework has the following advantages, among others:
* **Regular routes and hashtag based routes** are supported.
* **Simple plain html and js** because no special components or attributes are required. Regular links can be used and named routes can be called by using a special router protocol.
* **Routing hooks** are supported. This makes it possible to call code before or after routing has occured. It also allows to cancel routing based on conditions - a concept known as guards in other frameworks.
* **Redirects and aliases** are supported. Both delegate to another component. However, redirects change the URL, aliases keep the URL.
* **Nested routing** can be easily achieved to support complex routing scenarios.

These and other concepts will be explained step by step in this guide.
