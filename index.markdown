# Overview

**Hof.js** is a **modern framework** for the development of **Single Page Applications**. It is an **open source project of Hof University of Applied Sciences** and **was created by Prof. Dr. Walter Kern**.


## Key features
This framework has the following advantages, among others:
* **Extremely simple implementation** of apps based on Web Components and other web standards.
* **Deep state observability, including arrays and nested properties**, i.e. persons.push(newPerson) or person.address.name=newName are recognized and re-render only depending parts of the UI.
* **Incremental enhancement of existing web applications** because individual components can be added to any web application created with another framework, as they are just web components.
* **Stores can simply be implemented by using pure JS** instead of special libraries because the deep observability functionality of this frameworks makes concepts like that obsolete.
* **Easy start of development**, since no transpiler, CLI or tool is needed. It is enough to include the framework which is only a few KB in size.
* **IDEs provide best support even without extensions/plugins** since the code is pure JS.
